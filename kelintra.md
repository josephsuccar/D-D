#   Background

>"My name is Kelintra. As a child, I grew up in a temple of eilistraee. My whole life I caught strange glances, as if the elders of the temple believed I would spontaenously errupt in flames at any moment. I knew they were grooming me for something important, but I never knew what. When I was old enough, I began a pilgrimage to the surface. My mission was simple: Do good, and oppose darkness, especially the corruption of Drow from the tyrant Lolth. In time I might discover the secrets of parentage, rumored to be of a divine origin."

## Divine Sense
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

## Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

## Divine Smite
Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

## Divine Health
By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.

## Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Aura of Protection
Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

## Tenets of the Ancients

The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

  * **Kindle the Light.** Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.

  * **Shelter the Light.** Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.

  * **Preserve Your Own Light.** Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can't preserve it in the world.

  * **Be the Light.** Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.

##  Oath of the Ancients Spells
| Paladin Level	| Spells| 
| -- | -- |
| 3rd | Ensnaring Strike, Speak with Animals |
| 5th | Moonbeam, Misty Step |

## Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

  * **Nature's Wrath.** You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke primeval forces to ensnare a foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees itself and the vines vanish.

  * **Turn the Faithless.** You can use your Channel Divinity to utter ancient words that are painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

    If the creature's true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

## Divine Magic
Your link to the divine allows you to learn spells normally associated with the cleric class. When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the cleric spell list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you.

In addition, choose an affinity for the source of your divine power: good, evil, law, chaos, or neutrality. You learn an additional spell based on that affinity, as shown below. It is a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of sorcerer spells known. If you later replace this spell, you must replace it with a spell from the cleric spell list.

| Affinity |	Spell |
| - | - |
| Good	| Cure Wounds |
| Evil	| Inflict Wounds |
| Law	| Bless |
| Chaos	| Bane |
| Neutrality	|Protection from Evil and Good |

## Favored by the Gods
Starting at 1st level, divine power guards your destiny. If you fail a saving throw or miss with an attack roll, you can roll 2d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Elf: Drow

| Trait | Description |
| - | - |
| Speed | Your base walking speed is 30 feet.|
|Superior Darkvision | Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.|
| Keen Senses | You have proficiency in the Perception skill. | 
| Fey Ancestry | You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep. |
| Trance |  Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. |
| Sunlight Sensitivity |  You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. |
| Drow Magic | You know the Dancing Lights cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Faerie Fire spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the Darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. |
| Drow Weapon Training | You have proficiency with rapiers, shortswords, and hand crossbows.|
